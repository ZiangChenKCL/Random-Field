# Random-Field

#### Ziang Chen @ Kings College London

## Description

This project aim to provide the code implementation based on research of Random-Field, include **Uniform Field** and **Complex network**

For the **Uniform Field**, this project taken the ordinary differential equation approach to express the percolation behaviour on it, the practical example is SIR model in Epidemic.

For the **Complex network**, this project use **Random Graph** method with some degree distribution to represent its property. 

This project also provide some tools to shown the result, and GPU acceleration using the vetorilize method based on Graph theory.

There was some paper published based on these code and I have some other research wait to be completed, hopefully everything will be okay in the future.
